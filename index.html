    <h1>Introduction</h1>

    <p>
This document provides guidance to implementers that are developing software
for the Decentralized Identifier ecosystem.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="informative">
    <h1>Security Design</h1>

    <p>
Decentralized Identifiers are security primitives that are often used to
secure important systems. This section speaks to topics that implementers
might consider when thinking about the security characteristics of their
software systems.
    </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Establishing a DID</h2>

      <p>
In order to create secure DID systems, it is important to consider the process
of establishing a Decentralized Identifier.
      </p>

      <p class="issue">
Explain how establishing cryptographic assurances for the identifier from the
inception of the identifier are critical in ensuring that the security of the
system isn't compromised through attacks against the creation process.
      </p>
    </section>

  </section>

  <section class="informative">
    <h1>Privacy Design</h1>

    <p>
Decentralized Identifiers, like any other technology, can be used to enhance
privacy as well as harm privacy. This section speaks to topics that implementers
might consider when thinking about the privacy characteristics of their
software systems.
