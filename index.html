    <h2>
JSON-LD and DID Documents
    </h2>

    <p>
[[!JSON-LD]] is a JSON-based format used to serialize
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/ld-glossary/#linked-data">Linked Data</a>. The
syntax is designed to easily integrate into deployed systems already using
JSON, and provides a smooth upgrade path from JSON to JSON-LD. It is primarily
intended to be a way to use Linked Data in Web-based programming environments,
to build interoperable Web services, and to store Linked Data in JSON-based
storage engines.
    </p>

    <p>
JSON-LD is useful when extending the data model described in this specification.
Instances of the data model are encoded in JSON-LD in the same way they are
encoded in JSON, with the addition of
the <code>@context</code> property. The
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#the-context">JSON-LD Context</a>
is described in detail in the [[!JSON-LD]] specification and its use is
elaborated on in Section <a href="#json-ld-extensibility"></a>.
    </p>

    <p>
In general, the data model and syntaxes described in this document are designed
such that developers can copy and paste examples into their software systems.
The design goal of this approach is to provide a low barrier to entry while
still ensuring global interoperability between a heterogeneous set of software
systems. This section describes some of these approaches, which will likely go
unnoticed by most developers, but whose details will be of interest to
implementers. Noteworthy features provided by JSON-LD are:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
The <code>@id</code> and <code>@type</code> keywords are aliased to
<code>id</code> and <code>type</code> respectively, enabling developers to use
this specification as idiomatic JSON.
        </li>
        <li>
Data types, such as integers, dates, units of measure, and URLs, are
automatically typed to provide stronger type guarantees for use cases that
require them.
        </li>
        <li>
The <code>@protected</code> properties feature of JSON-LD 1.1 is used to ensure
that terms defined by this specification cannot be overridden. This means that
as long as the same <code>@context</code> declaration is made at the top of a
<a>DID document</a>, interoperability is guaranteed between implementations
that use a JSON-LD processor and implementations that do not.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <section>
        <h2>
Contexts
        </h2>

        <p>
When two software systems need to exchange data, they need to use terminology
and a protocol that both systems understand. The <code>@context</code>
property ensures that two systems operating on the same DID document are using
mutually agreed terminology.
        </p>

        <p>
<a>DID documents</a> MUST include the <code>@context</code> property.
        </p>

        <p class="note" title="The JSON-LD Context">
More information about the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#the-context">JSON-LD Context</a> in
general can be found in the [[JSON-LD]] specification.
        </p>

        <dl>
            <dt><dfn>@context</dfn></dt>
            <dd>
The value of the <code>@context</code> property MUST be one or more <a>URIs</a>,
where the value of the first <a>URI</a> is
<code>https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1</code>. If more than one <a>URI</a> is
provided, the <a>URIs</a> MUST be interpreted as an ordered set. It is
RECOMMENDED that dereferencing each <a>URI</a> results in a document containing
machine-readable information about the context.
            </dd>
        </dl>

        <pre class="example nohighlight">
{
    "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1"
}
        </pre>

        <p>
<a>DID method</a> specifications MAY define their own JSON-LD contexts. However,
it is NOT RECOMMENDED to define a new context unless the context is necessary to
properly implement the method. Method-specific contexts MUST NOT override the
terms defined in the generic <a>DID</a> context.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>JSON-LD Extensibility</h2>

        <p>
One of the goals of the <a>decentralized identifiers</a> data model is to
enable permissionless innovation. The data model needs to be extensible in a
number of different ways, including:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
Modelling of complex multi-entity relationships is provided through the use of a
graph-based data model.
            </li>

            <li>
Extending the machine-readable vocabularies used to describe information in the
data model, without relying on a centralized system, is accomplished through
the use of [[?LINKED-DATA]].
            </li>

            <li>
Support for multiple types of cryptographic proof formats is accomplished
through the use of Linked Data Proofs and Linked Data Signatures [[?LD-PROOFS]],
and a variety of signature suites.
            </li>

            <li>
All of the extensibility mechanisms outlined above are provided in a data format
that is popular among software developers and web page authors and is enabled
through the use of [[!JSON-LD]].
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
This approach to data modeling is often called an <em>open worldassumption</em>,
meaning that anyone can say anything about any other thing. This approach often
seems in conflict with building simple and predictable software systems.
Balancing extensibility with program correctness is always more challenging with
an open world assumption than it is with closed software systems.
        </p>

        <p>
The rest of this section describes how both extensibility and program
correctness are achieved through a series of examples.
        </p>

        <p>
Let us assume that we start with the following <a>DID document</a>.
        </p>

        <pre class="example nohighlight" title="A simple DID document">
{
    "@context": "https://example.org/example-method/v1",
    "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
    "publicKey": [{ <span class="comment">...</span> }],
    "authentication": [{ <span class="comment">...</span> }],
    "service": [{ <span class="comment">...</span> }]
}
        </pre>

        <p>
The contents of the <code>publicKey</code>, <code>authentication</code>, and
<code>service</code> properties are not important for the purpose of this
section. What is important is that the object above is a valid
<a>DID document</a>. Now assume that a developer wants to extend the
<a>DID document</a> to express an additional piece of information, the subject's
public photo stream.
        </p>

        <p>
The first thing that a developer would do is create a JSON-LD Context containing
the new term.
        </p>

        <pre class="example nohighlight" title="An example JSON-LD Context">
{
    "@context": {
        "PhotoStreamService": "https://example.com/vocab#PhotoStreamService"
    }
}
        </pre>

        <p>
Now that the JSON-LD Context is created, the developer MUST publish it somewhere
that is accessible to any <a>DID document</a> processor. For this example,
assume that the JSON-LD Context above is published at
<code>did:example:contexts:987654321</code>. At this point, extending the first
example in this section is just a matter of including the context above and
adding the new property to the <a>DID document</a>.
        </p>

        <pre class="example nohighlight" title="A DID document with a custom extension">
{
    "@context": "https://example.org/example-method/v1",
    "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",
    "authentication": [ <span class="comment">...</span> ],
    "service": [<span class="highlight">{
        "@context": "did:example:contexts:987654321",
        "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#photos",
        "type": "PhotoStreamService",
        "serviceEndpoint": "https://example.org/photos/379283"
    }</span>]
}
        </pre>

        <p>
The examples so far show that it is easy to extend the
<a>decentralized identifiers</a> data model in a permissionless and
decentralized way. The mechanism also ensures that
<a>decentralized identifiers</a> created in this way prevent namespace conflicts
and semantic ambiguity.
        </p>

        <p>
An extensibility model this dynamic does increase the implementation burden.
Software written for such a system needs to determine if accepting
<a>DID documents</a> with extensions is acceptable based on the risk profile of
the application. Some applications might choose to accept but ignore extensions,
others might choose to only accept certain extensions, while highly secure
environments might disallow extensions. These decisions are up to the
application developers and are specifically not the domain of this
specification.
        </p>

        <p>
Implementations MUST produce an error when an extension JSON-LD Context
overrides the expanded URL for a term specified in this specification. To avoid
the possibility of accidentally overriding terms, developers SHOULD scope their
extensions. For example, the following extension scopes the new
<code>PhotoStreamService</code> term so that it can only be used within the
<code>service</code> property:
        </p>

        <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Scoping terms in a JSON-LD Context">
{
    "@context": {
        <span class="highlight">"service": {
            "@id": "https://w3id.org/did#service",
            "@context": {
                "PhotoStreamService": "https://example.com/vocab#PhotoStreamService"
            }
        }</span>
    }
}
        </pre>

        <p>
Developers are urged to ensure that extension JSON-LD Contexts are highly
available. Implementations that cannot fetch a context will produce an error.
Strategies for ensuring that extension JSON-LD Contexts are always available
include using content-addressed URLs for contexts, bundling context documents
with implementations, or enabling aggressive caching of contexts.

      <h2>Establishing a DID</h2>

      <p>
In order to create secure DID systems, it is important to consider the process
of establishing a Decentralized Identifier.
      </p>

      <p class="issue">
Explain how establishing cryptographic assurances for the identifier from the
inception of the identifier are critical in ensuring that the security of the

    <h1>Privacy Design</h1>

    <p>
Decentralized Identifiers, like any other technology, can be used to enhance

    <h1>
Future Work
    </h1>

    <section>
      <h2>
Upper Limits on DID Character Length
      </h2>

      <p>
The current specification does not take a position on maximum length of a
<a>DID</a>. The maximum interoperable URL length is currently about 2K
characters. QR codes can handle about 4K characters. Clients using <a>DIDs</a>
will be responsible for storing many <a>DIDs</a>, and some methods would be able
to externalize some of their costs onto clients by relying on more complicated
signature schemes or by adding state into <a>DIDs</a> intended for temporary
use. A future version of this specification should set reasonable limits on
<a>DID</a> character length to minimize externalities.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>
Equivalence
      </h2>

      <p>
Including an equivalence property, such as <code>equivID</code>, in <a>DID
documents</a> whose value is an array of <a>DIDs</a> would allow subjects to
assert two or more <a>DIDs</a> that represent the same subject. This capability
has numerous uses, including supporting migration between <a>verifiable data
registries</a> and providing forward compatibility of existing <a>DIDs</a> to
future <a>verifiable data registries</a>. In theory, equivalent <a>DIDs</a>
should have the same identifier rights, allowing verifiable credentials
[[?VC-DATA-MODEL]] made against one <a>DID</a> to apply to equivalent
<a>DIDs</a>. Equivalence was not included in the current specification due to
the complexity of verifying equivalence across different <a>DLTs</a> and
different <a>DID methods</a>, and also of aggregating properties of equivalent
<a>DID documents</a>. However equivalence should be supported in a future
version of this specification.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>
Verifiable Timestamps
      </h2>

      <p>
<a>Verifiable timestamps</a> have significant utility for identifier records.
This is a good fit for <a>DLTs</a>, since most offer some type of timestamp
mechanism. Despite some transactional cost, they are the among the most
censorship-resistant transaction ordering systems at the present, so they are
nearly ideal for <a>DID document</a> timestamping. In some cases a <a>DLT</a>'s
immediate timing is approximate, however their sense of
<a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0113.mediawiki%23Abstract">
"median time past" (see Bitcoin BIP 113)</a> can be precisely defined. A generic
<a>DID document</a> timestamping mechanism could would work across all
<a>DLTs</a> and might operate via a mechanism including either individual
transactions or transaction batches. The generic mechanism was deemed out of
scope for this version, although it may be included in a future version of this
specification.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>
Time Locks and DID Document Recovery
      </h2>

      <p>
Section <a href="#key-revocation-and-recovery"></a> mentions one possible clever
use of time locks to recover control of a <a>DID</a> after a key compromise. The
technique relies on an ability to override the most recent update to a <a>DID
document</a> with Authorization applied by an earlier version of the <a>DID
document</a> in order to defeat the attacker. This protection depends on adding
a <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0065.mediawiki%23Abstract">
time lock (see Bitcoin BIP 65)</a> to protect part of the transaction chain,
enabling a Authorization block to be used to recover control. We plan to add
support for time locks in a future version of this specification.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>
Smart Signatures
      </h2>

      <p>
Not all <a>DLTs</a> can support the Authorization logic in section <a
href="#authorization-and-delegation"></a>. Therefore, in this version of the
specification, all Authorization logic is delegated to <a>DID method</a>
specifications. A potential future solution is a <a
href="http://www.weboftrust.info/downloads/smart-signatures.pdf">Smart
Signature</a> specification that specifies the code any conformant <a>DLT</a>
may implement to process signature control logic.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>
Verifiable Credentials
      </h2>

      <p>
Although <a>DIDs</a> and <a>DID documents</a> form a foundation for
decentralized identity, they are only the first step in describing their
subjects. The rest of the descriptive power comes through collecting and
selectively using Verifiable Credentials [[VC-DATA-MODEL]]. Future versions of
the specification will describe in more detail how <a>DIDs</a> and <a>DID
document</a> can be integrated with &mdash; and help enable &mdash; the
Verifiable Credentials ecosystem.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>
Alternate Serializations and Graph Models
      </h2>

      <p>
This version of the specification relies on JSON-LD and the RDF graph
model for expressing a <a>DID document</a>. Future versions of this
specification might specify other semantic graph formats for a <a>DID
document</a>.
